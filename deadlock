What is a Deadlock?
A deadlock occurs when two or more processes/threads are waiting for resources in such a way that none of them can proceed.
	• Example:
		○ Thread A locks Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2.
		○ Thread B locks Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1.
		○ Both are waiting forever → program stuck.
	• Deadlocks usually happen in multithreading or database transactions.
👉 In simple terms: Deadlock is like two people blocking each other in a narrow hallway—both refuse to move, so nobody can pass.
