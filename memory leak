🔹 What is a Memory Leak?
A memory leak happens when a program allocates memory but never releases it, even though it’s no longer needed.
	• This causes memory usage to grow over time → system slows down or crashes.
	• Common in long-running apps like web servers, desktop apps, or services.
	• Example in C#:
		○ Subscribing to an event but never unsubscribing.
		○ Holding references in a static collection.
👉 In simple terms: Memory leak is like borrowing books from the library and never returning them—the library eventually runs out of space.
